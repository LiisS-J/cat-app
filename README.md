# Happy Paws

Happy Paws is a cat adoption site where applicants can view all cats currently up for adoption and fill out an application to adopt a cat. 
The app also has an Admint functionality where the App's Admin has the ability to update cat details and delete a cat entry when the cat gets adopted.

####Technologies Used: 
The whole game is built solely using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, although JavaScript does majority of the work.

#### Getting Started: 

[CatApp](https://liiss-j.github.io/numbers-game/)
[CatApp project's Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/A0TD6I68/project-2-node-express-mongodb)



####Planned future enhancements:

* The App should have a separate view for the Administrator that lets them manage all cat entries and applicant forms behind the scenes.
* Setting up database so Administrator could add a photo for each cat
* Add a donation feature where users could donate items in need to each cat
