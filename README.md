# Happy Paws

Happy Paws is a cat adoption app where applicants can view all cats currently up for adoption and apply to adopt a cat they like. They are able to access the cat's full details and also see how many other applicants the cat may have.
Whileas not fully built out, the app also allows the administrator to update cat details and delete a cat entry when the cat gets adopted.
